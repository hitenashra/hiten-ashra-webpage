    <b><u>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</u></b>
    <p>
        My homepage is a basic grid layout housing links for each individual page, each image contains a sculpted furniture that I admire as it represents my personality. My about section contains a profile picture of me, with a bright green border for emphasis, followed by a short paragraph about myself. Unit 1, Outcome 1 is a written section exploring the process of creating a blog, going in-depth into the pros and cons of digital projects, the IT within aswell as the software used.

    <b><u>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</u></b>
    <p>
      Copyrights are inherently introduced to websites and their content to protect any original work; a copyright text is usually added at the bottom of a webpage as a deterrent from others stealing content <a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/360744/what-is-a-pdf-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/>[8]</a>. When GDPR was introduced, websites and companies are responsible for the necessary steps considered ‘appropriate’ to prevent personal data from being accidentally or deliberately compromised. This is practiced by implementing  SSL certification onto your site for encryption of personal data; by testing your site for vulnerabilities and for updating the software regularly including the operating system and the management system. <a href=https://www.hallaminternet.com/internet-marketing-and-the-law-legal-issues-affecting-you-and-your-website/>[10]</a>

    <b><u>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</u></b>
    <p>
        Web accessibility is verifiable when a website, tools and technologies have been designed and developed with the intention that people with disabilities can use and access them. To be more specific, individuals can preceive, understand, navigate and interact aswell as contribute to the Web. Web accessibility should encompass all disabilites, including: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual. A couple solutions for making the web more accessible are A) using subtitles and transcripts - this is particularly important for sites that house videos. B) get clickable - this is a solution for users with mobility issues, a clickable item should have a wider range so the user simply has to click within the general area. <a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/360744/what-is-a-pdf-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/>[11]</a>

    <b><u>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</u></b>
    <p>
        There are two main filetypes when dealing with websites - .HTML and .CSS. Wihtout these, the website would fail to function and a thought out and considered design would not be possible. For image filetypes, there are also two standards - .JPEG and .PNG. .JPEG, standing for Joint Photographic Experts Group, has a so called "Lossy" compression; this means that image quality is lost as the image is compressed. .JPEG's are predominantly used for images produced by digital photography and they are a good choice for pictures with complex colors and shading. .PNG, standing for Portable Network Graphics, on the otherhand, has a so called "Lossless" compression; this means that the image quality remains the same as the image is compressed. .PNG was created as an improved replacement for GIFs and is now the most common lossless image compression format on the internet. <a href=https://undsgn.com/jpg-vs-png/#:~:text=PNG%20stands%20for%20Portable%20Network,%2Dcalled%20%E2%80%9Clossless%E2%80%9D%20compression.&text=JPEG%20or%20JPG%20stands%20for,that%20of%20the%20PNG%20files.>[12]</a>
        A final filetype to consider for websites are .PDF; a document format that can contain text, images, embedded fonts, hyperlinks, video, interactive buttons, forms, and more. <a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/360744/what-is-a-pdf-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/>[13]</a>
