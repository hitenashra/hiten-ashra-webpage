    <b><u>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</u></b>
    <br>
    In a modern business, IT fuels innovation <a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380#:~:text=Information%20technology%20fosters%20innovation%20in,enhances%20quality%2C%20and%20boosts%20productivity.">[1]</a>. With the progression of technology, we saw innovation in things such as faster data processing, improved data storage and a wider distribution of information. The radical change due to these innovations reinforced the running of modern business operations. The introduction of E-Commerce/ Online shopping allowed small local businesses to expand to a global market; this can be linked to the development of Digital Marketing, a cheaper and more inclusive way of promoting/ advertising business on a mass scale.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Methods:</b></li>
        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Agile -	A set of principles for developing software. Its manifesto outlines four key values: Individuals and interactions > Processes and tools; Working software > Comprehensive documentation; Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation and Responding to change > Following a plan. Agile ultimately is described as a flexible, iterative design and building process.</li>
                <li>Scrum -	Enabling a  cross-functional, self-managing, small team to deliver quickly and efficiently. Scrum's goal is to improve communication, teamwork and the speed of development. </li>
                <li>Kanban - By increasing the visibility of the work in progress, whilst also improving the speed and quality of deliverables aswell as limiting multi-tasking.  </li>
                <li>Scrumban - Adding a limitation on the progression of work like that is associated with Kanban whilst maintaining a the routine of a daily stand up like Scrum </li>
                <li>Lean - Delivering more with less by streamlining and eliminating waste </li>
                <li>eXtreme Programming (XP) - Ensuring quality by robustly pushing development </li>
                <li>Waterfall -	A method of fully planning out a project, then executing through phases </li>
                <li>PRINCE2 - Leaving nothing to chance by controlling the project management  </li>
                <li>PMI's PMBOK - Embodying the waterfall project management whilst applying universal standards </li>
                <a href="https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/project-management-methodologies-made-simple/#kanban">[2]</a>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li><b>Skills:</b>
        <br>
        Thinking logically, one could say the skills required to run a successful project would be a physical skillset, such as having the ability to code python or HTML - or something more creative such as Adobe cloud. But to me, the key skills to run a successful project would be A) Problem-Solving; during a project, one will have to handle time-lines, budgets and management; these tasks change from day to day and without that critical thinking, the success of the project is compromised  B) Adaptability; if youre able to be adaptable, in your decision making aswell as your thinking and skillset, a project is less likely to have errors as solutions can be created by anyone and everyone C) A Positive Outlook; this is extremely important when managing a successful project, with a positive outlook, one glues together a team that will almost certainly have its ups and downs, including lapses of demotivation. <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/what-skills-do-i-need-to-be-a-digital-project-manager ">[3]</a></li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Resources:</b>
        <br>
        Boards such as pintrest (for creative projects) or Trello (for methodical aspects of projects) are two examples of resources that can take a project from the ideating phase to a success. These resources provide a foundation for a project, Pintrest allows us to moodboard and ideate whilst showing references that identify with a specific direction. Trello lets a team be managed using any of the previously mentioned methods whilst being able to dictate which actions must be completed by which team member and by a particular date; further more, it is an extremely flexible resource, that is highly adaptable to the eb and flow of an ongoing project. </li>

        <b><u>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT</u></b>
        <br>
        Having used Trello to plan previous projects, I found that planning my tasks using the Kanban method via Trello really gives me a clear and concise direction, focusing on what still needs to be done aswell as knowing what is currently in progress. If I was working with a team, Trello would allow me to assign tasks to individuals and label tasks accordingly. How I intended to plan this project was by splitting the tasks in areas of work - HTML; CSS; Unit 1; Unit 2; Image sourcing etc.

        <b><u>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</u></b>
        <br>
        Digital projects have their benefits, but there are several risks involved with working digitally. One risk that can cause a project to fail is a lack of leadership; when working digitally, one person is required to take control, this person needs to be holding their peers accountable because if every member of the team isn't invested or doesnt feel supported, cracks start to form; a weakened structure will always fail. A second possible risk of digital projects is the lack of planning/the introduction of a timeline. This is severly important and plays hand in hand with the resources used within a digital projcet. With a lack of direction, teams work off the path of the project, they essentially work ineffectively as 2 members could begin working on the same task without knowing and a more important task is left untouched. <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/09/13/are-these-the-real-reasons-why-tech-projects-fail/#51eceaad7320>[4]</a>

        <b><u>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</u></b>
        <br>
        When considering the selection and uses of IT systems/software for a digital project, you must consider the impact on usability, interoperability, support costs and the ability to migrate materials over time. Making intelligent selections calls for an assessment of internal needs and resources, if the user and/or client have made specific requests, an assessment should be made of what options are available in relation to IT Systems and software that will have the greatest outcome. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The infographic below suggests an order of consideration made towards selecting IT Systems and Software for a project. In the case of a project, it can be suggested that you think about A) The purpose: do you have a viable and worthwhile project? If so, establish a project management framework as well as an outline plan. Then you must think about B) The tasks at hand: you should prepare an initial business case for the project followed by identifying risks and issues, this will help when considering the IT Systems and software selection. Once this has been done, a project team must be appointed and an inital plan should be developed. What must finally be thought about are C) The deliverables: from parts A and B, you should be providing the client/user with the business case, a project charter, a project initiation document and the project plan.

        <br>
        Trello is a free application empowering the tracking of tasks through stages, collaborative task lists and the ability to make comments and share content, such as screenshots and files. Trello is used by creating lists to categorise individual tasks, these tasks are labelled as 'cards' and can hold a huge amount of information including files, links, screenshots, checklists, and messages from your collaborators.<a href=https://flowji.com/how-to-use-trello-to-manage-your-website-project/>[6]</a>

        <br>
        GitHub is an platform which allows users to host their code and digital projects, along with ongoing multiple amendments which Github will automatically identify and change accordingly, meaning the most current version is always accessible. Each time an upload is made, GitHub prompts the user to add a commit message so anyone who sees the project can see when the changes have been made. <a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/>[7]</a>

        <b><u>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</u></b>
        <br>
        GDPR was introduced as a way to be more transparent about the way companies collect and use data, it changed the landscape of privacy. The new rules were enforced after 23 years of lessons learned, it added new definitions and requirements to reflect the changes in technology which simply did not exist in the dialup era. There are 2 particular areas of data at the forefront, personal and sensitive data; personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Sensitive data relates to Racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health data, sex life or sexual orientation and past or spent criminal convictions. GDPR then expanded the definition of personal data to include genetic data,biometric data (such as facial recognition or fingerprint logins), location data, pseudonymized data and online identifiers.<a href=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/>[8]</a> This is likely to impact Digital Marketing more than any other field withing the digital sector as the obtainability of data and information has now become more difficult.
