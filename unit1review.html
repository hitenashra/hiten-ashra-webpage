    <b><u>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</u></b>
    <p>To review the project at its current state, the understanding and manipulation of HTML and CSS has been rather difficult to wrap my head around, it took alot of external research and late night practice sessions to develop an understanding of how to intergrate the necassery code into visual studio code. VSC itself is a great tool and is particularly handy when it comes to CSS, the drop down feature makes finding what you want a hell of alot easier. When it came to using Trello, it was quite a pointless application to use, the project required last second adaptations which nullified the use of trello. That being said, Trello did set the plan a action, which let me keep track of where I was at and what I was missing.

    <b><u>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</u></b>
    <p>
        In my opinion, Trello was not an appropriate tool for this particular project, I think an application that is more adaptable and quick to change and requires less maintainance would be more effective. As for Visual Studio Code, the application itself is fantastic and it had endless capabilities, I believe it is an asset to this project. From the colour coded text, to the drop down boxes, there was a underlying helping hand which made life a bit more bearable when learning code.

    <b><u>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</u></b>
    <p>
        I am quite pleased with my website, I designed it with my personality in mind. I stuck with a simple aesthetic with bright, bold colours. I spent the first few days of the project inspecting webpage references which I had saved over the previous weekend, here is one for example: <a href=https://www.ayotoataraxia.com/></a>After it clicked that this dream was not possible within this time span, I simplified my ideas, making the imagery and content bolder and the center of attention. The reference shown is where I would have liked to have taken my website. I myself am not a fan of navigation drop down bars and opted to stick to a simple one that was placed under my title, I think there is room for further development here.

    <b><u>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</u></b>
    <p>
        With more time, there are many drastic changes I would make. I would have liked to add in alot of animation, more logos and interactive imagery. I also think that I would have reduced the text as it gets very boring to read, but the content is what makes this project what it is. I would love to have created a more dynamic drop down box that was attached to the logo and was animated in more a unique way, that will be something I will be continuing to develop. With my keen interest in art and design, I would also have like to have dedicated more time towards introducing a more unique colour palette aswell as more interesting shapes and lines, something that represented my influences such as Jean Arp, Mark Rothko, Isamu Noguchi, Henry Moore and Barbra Hepworth.

    <b><u>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</u></b>
    <p>
        Having spent time researching into the deeper workings of IT systems and software, I believe the discoveries I made were inline with the outcomes, there was a thorough assessment of my own work, its planning, its efficiency aswell as design. I scrutinised each aspect of my site, by typing up the simplest code to ensure that my understanding of how the CSS interacts with the HMTL is confirmed, I then continued to develop the code whilst going back and forth from my browser, constantly refreshing the page and noting the differences and contemplating if I prefered it prior to the changes. The biggest change I made, which also brought me the most job was the home page, it ended up feeling more considered and aligned with my design ethos.

    UNIT 1, OUTCOME 3 (REVIEW)
</div>
<br>
<div class="onepoint1">
    <b><u>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</u></b>
    <p>
        A major benefit of Visual Studio Code is the drop down boxes that appear whilst typing, it allows the coder to be highly efficient when coding and gives you options if and when the coder is feeling indecisive. A drawback to using Visual Studio Code is the lack of connectivity between HTML, CSS and the webpage itself. I have seen a site called codepen.io and that may be a tool that would bring in that connectivity. Trello was particularly handy when it came to labelling, dating and assigning tasks, it kept me on track and allowed me to make quick adjustments to my timeline as I began improvising the design of my site.

<div class="onepoint1">
    <b><u>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</u></b>
    <p>
        To improve productivity, I think I would have created a photoshop draft design to map out how the overall design would be; this would include a grid layout, multiple font options and multiple layout options. I would also moodboard references and label specific parts and inspect the code via google chrome and understand the code.

    <b><u>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</u></b>
    <p>
        A solution I would develop to improve my own productivity would be the mapped out draft design using photoshop, as previously stated, having a draft plan would reduce the ambiguity in my design ideas. Further more, having references of web pages that influence my ideas would let me adapt existing code for my personal use, cutting down learning and developing time.

    <b><u>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</u></b>
    <p>
        When it comes to testing digital solutions, you must first consider the target audience, which countries they reside in, the type of people they are etc. It is then important that you test the digital solution to its rivals, this way, you will get a good understanding of how your solution compares to the current solution.  I also find it important and extremely valuable that your peers go through and scrutinise your work, you will always receive true and raw feedback. Its also important to check the performance of your solution on multiple devices, this includes mobile and tablet - ensuring you are testing the flex, the zoom, the scroll etc. <a href=https://www.deeperthanblue.co.uk/a-guide-to-device-testing-for-digital-solutions/>[9]</a>
